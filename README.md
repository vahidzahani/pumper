## Open-source Crypto Trading Assistant using Binance API

This project started as a simple program to retrieve pump and dump signals from a specific channel. Driven by a desire to create more sophisticated trading tools, it evolved into a fully-fledged **open-source crypto trading assistant for the Binance platform**.

**Features:**

* Automate trades based on technical indicators and custom strategies.
* Receive real-time market data and news updates.
* Manage multiple cryptocurrency positions.
* Backtest strategies with historical data.

**Contributions Welcome:**

I am actively looking for developers and traders to contribute to this project. Feel free to submit Pull Requests with bug fixes, new features, or improved strategies.
